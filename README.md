SPHEREx-lab
===========

This is a proof-of-concept implementation for the joint proof-of-concept that SPHEREx, Rubin Observatory, and the Texas Advanced Computing Center did in June and July 2024.

It is a [Phalanx](https://phalanx.lsst.io)-launchable JupyterLab container, containing the non-export-controlled parts of the SPHEREx analysis pipeline as the primary kernel, but with JupyterLab machinery in its own Python environment.
